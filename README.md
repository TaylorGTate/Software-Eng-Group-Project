# Team-3-Fall-19

WELCOME TO OUR GROUP PROJECT THAT ACTS AS A DOCTOR'S OFFICE PROGRAM W/ DB. ENJOY CREATING APPOINTMENTS AND ACTING LIKE A PATIENT, DOCTOR, 
OR MANAGER!

HOW TO SET UP DB TABLES IN MYSQL:
1.) Open a new query tab after setting up for MySQL regularly. (set username to "root" and password to "toor" for simplicity)
2.) Paste the contents of the DOMSdb.sql file in the tab.  (Team-3-Fall-19 > DOMS > db > DOMSdb.sql
3.) Uncomment the create schema and create table lines and run those using the "execute the statement under the keyboard cursor" run option
4.) The tables should be created. Note that if you need to delete or select tables those commands are avaliable and just have to be 
    uncommented and ran. 


HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM: 
1.) Open the program in Eclipse (or your favorite IDE) 
2.) Click run
3.) Note that you will be prompted for your username and password for the DB. If you followed the recommended set up mentioned above, 
    your username should be "root" and your password should be "toor". 
4.) You will then be asked if you would like to seed the DB. Only do this the first time to have DB data and objects to work with. 

     WARNING - If you click yes to this after creating new objects and DB data, then your data will be lost. 
  

THANKS FOR USING OUR GROUP PROJECT! HAVE A NICE DAY!
